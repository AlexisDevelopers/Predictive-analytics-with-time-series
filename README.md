This code is an example of predictive analytics with time series using the Statsmodels library in Python. The objective is to predict the number of monthly international passengers for an airline.

The code uses various Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn, to perform exploratory data analysis and predictions.

The eval_predictions function is used to calculate the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the actual values and the predictions. The stationarity_test function performs stationarity tests on the time series.

The data set used is that of monthly international passengers from 1949 to 1960. First, a seasonal decomposition is performed to visualize the trend, seasonality, and randomness of the time series. Then, a training-test separation is performed to train the model and evaluate it.

The chosen model is Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES), also known as Holt-Winters. This technique is suitable for data with trend and seasonality and is an extension of the exponential smoothing method. Finally, the prediction evaluation metrics are printed and the original time series is plotted together with the predictions made.
